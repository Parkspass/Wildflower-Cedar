At the center are three stamens and a three- pronged style. Because they are tightly packed, they lose less moisture to evaporation during dry summer conditions. Most of its biomass is located in an underground taproot that stores nutrients over the winter and anchors it in the erodible soils. These nutrients are mobilized in the spring to allow the plant to grow and flower quickly as soon as conditions are favorable and before soils dry out. Leaves are linear, ciliate and thick. Plant grows to about three inches tall.","General": "Along the rims above Cedar Breaks, Cushion Phlox is one of the earliest species to flower as temperatures warm in the spring. Often, the flowers cover the plant so thickly that it is like a small patch of snow. Cushion Phlox is a classic example of the ‘cushion growth form’ with a set of adaptations to the harsh, exposed conditions on the rims. By lying close to the ground, it is out of the wind where temperatures can be 10 degrees or more above air temperatures, an advantage early in the season. Densely blooms June to August, forming carpets of flowers. Grows at elevations between 8,000 to 13,000 feet. Favorite to butterflies and moths.

These act as a ‘sail’ waiting for the wind to disperse the seeds.","General": "This delightful spring wildflower is in the ‘Geum’ genus which is a group of about 50 flowers in the Rose family, although this species has little likeness to familiar roses. It is known by another genus called ‘Avens’, of the rose family which has white, purple, red or yellow flowers. Prefers rich, prairie loams, clay and sand soil in dry open woods, prairies, open slopes and mountain meadows. Prefers full sun and enjoys dry to moderate moisture and well drained soils. Once established, it is drought tolerant. Favors cool summer climates. Bumble bees are the primary pollinators. Since the Prairie Smoke is an early bloomer, the hungry Queen will seek out this plant for food. They will grasp the globe- shaped flower and beat her wings to shake the pollen onto her abdomen for collection. She will rake the pollen, combine it with nectar and pack it into her pollen basket.","Traditional Uses": "Native Americans would boil the roots to produce a root tea that was used medicinally for a variety of purposes, such as wound healing and sore throat treatments.","Alternate Names": "‘Old Man’s whiskers’, or ‘Purple Avens’"},

Clover is a favorite food to Butterflies. It also attracts bees and is a main nectar source to honeybees. Clover honey is well known for its excellent flavor. Clover is also an important food source to livestock and wildlife. It is high in protein, phosphorus and calcium, providing important nutrition. As with all members in the Pea family, this species has the ability to create nitrogen. Nitrogen fixing plants don’t pull nitrogen from the air on their own. They actually need help from a common bacteria called Rhizobium. The bacteria basically infect legume plants and uses the plant to help it draw nitrogen from the air. The bacteria changes this nitrogen gas and then stores it in the roots of the plant. When the plant stores the nitrogen in the roots, it produces a lump on the root called a nitrogen nodule. When nitrogen fixing plants and the bacteria work together to store nitrogen, they are creating a green warehouse. While growing, they release very little nitrogen into the soil, but when they die, their decomposition releases the stored nitrogen and increases the total nitrogen in soil. This makes nitrogen available for new plants later on.","Traditional Uses": "N/A","Alternate Names": "‘Longstock Clover’"},

It is found in grasslands, ponderosa pine woodlands, on rocky prairie hillsides, subalpine ridges and can survive on a wide range of soil types. Important food source for Butterflies. Attracts Hummingbirds. The banner petal usually has a white spot on it that serves as a signal for pollinators, often bees. As the flower ages, the spot turns reddish color and bees have learned to avoid these flowers, as the nectar prize will be limited. This helps the bees by guiding them to flowers with fresh and abundant nectar and helps the plant by keeping old pollen out of circulation. The pods that form after flowering hold anywhere from 2 to 5 brown seeds. Lupine species were named after the wolf (Canis lupis) because it was once thought that lupine species robbed the soil. Another belief is that since Lupine is poisonous; people thought that both the wolf and the plant killed livestock. Lupine is actually highly beneficial to neighboring plants because bacteria in the root nodules can fix atmospheric nitrogen, converting it to available nitrogen that actually enriches the soil and can assist other plants growing in the same area. This is true for all members of the Pea family.","Traditional Uses": "This species has several alkaloids which are concentrated in the seeds and young plants, making is poisonous to livestock, wildlife and humans. Causes weakness and muscular trembling or death if eaten in large quantities. Toxicity can be removed if thoroughly cooked. If eaten in small quantities, considered to be a fair to good forage to deer and elk. The Blackfoot used an infusion of lupine to relieve indigestion and gas and to stop hiccups.

The leaves have been used as a poultice mixed with oil to treat open sores. The whole plant is antiseptic. Assists in treating toothaches and other problems of the teeth and gums. Cherokee took it for disease of kidneys and bladder problems.","Alternate Names": "N/A"},
            {"Name": "Yarrow","Common": "Yarrow","Latin": "Achillea millefolium","Family": "Asteraceae (Sunflower/Aster)","Genus": "Achillea ","Species": "millefolium","Petals": "N/A","Size": "12-40 in","Leaves": "Alternate","Blooming": "May-Jul","Shape": "Radial symmetry","Color": "white","Description": "Yarrow produces one to several, erect stems that grow anywhere from one to three feet. There are usually 3 to 8 ray flowers that are ovate to round. Disk flowers range from 15 to 40. Flowers are white to white/yellow (sometimes light pink) and have a strong, sweet scent. Leaves are evenly distributed along the stem and are very hairy (pubescence). Leaves are 2 to 9 inches long, almost feathery and arranged spirally.","General": "This species will grow from sea level up to 12,000 feet. Frequently found in disturbed, well-drained soil of grasslands and open forests. Drought tolerant. Prefers sun to part shade. Recognized by pollination ecologists as attracting large numbers of native bees. Cavity-nesting birds such as the common starling use yarrow to line its nest. Moth larvae feed on this species. Ladybugs and butterflies also enjoy Yarrow nectar. Deer along with most foraging animals do not eat this plant, possibly because of the strong odor.","Traditional Uses": "Yarrow is a well-known herbal medicine and used in a wide assortment of disorders. Has been found to be valuable for treating wounds, treating colds, fevers and kidney diseases. Fresh leaves can be used to relieve pain from toothaches. The entire plant is used, both fresh and dried. This herb is an antiseptic, antispasmodic, mildly aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic and digestive. The genus name Achillea is for Achilles, whose soldiers allegedly used it to stem bleeding. Leaves are edible, raw or cooked. Even though there is a slight bitter flavor, they can be a good addition to salads or other cooking needs. A tea is made from the flowers and leaves. This plant has been proven to ward off mosquitoes when burned. The growing plant repels beetles, ants and flies.","Alternate Names": "‘Common Yarrow’, ‘Western Yarrow’ and ‘Milfoil’"},
            {"Name": "Yellow Evening Primrose","Common": "Yellow Evening Primrose","Latin": "Oenothera flava","Family": "Onagraceae (Evening Primrose)","Genus": "Oenothera ","Species": "flava","Petals": 4,"Size": "6 in","Leaves": "Basal","Blooming": "Jun-Aug","Shape": "Radial symmetry","Color": "yellow","Description": "Flowers are stemless, bright yellow and open in the evening, hence the name ‘Evening Primrose’. They may open up in under a minute and close when the sun comes up in the morning. The flowers have anywhere from four to eight stamens with four petals which range from 10-30mm in size. Four green sepals turn purple or orange as the flower gets older. One unique characteristic is the stigma, with linear lobes, has four branches in an X shape. The seedpod, which forms below the flower is also x-shaped. Leaves are basal, oblong-linear that form a rosette low to the ground. Plant is usually less than 8” tall.","General": "This eye-catching, beautiful plant often grows in prairie swales, open, wooded areas and stream valleys. Normally prefers growth in disturbed areas, such as a recently cleared range or along a roadside. Prefers damp to drier soils. Enjoys full sun or part shade. Because this species opens up at night, it attracts night pollinators such as moths and bats. Bees will try to pollinate for the short time it is open in the morning. Plants in this species have pollen grains that are held lightly together by viscin threads, so only insects that are morphologically specialized to gather pollen can pollinate the flowers. Bees with scopa cannot hold it. This plant is an important food source by some Lepidoptera species, including the white-lined sphinx. Some species feed exclusively on this plant.","Traditional Uses": "N/A","Alternate Names": "‘long tube Evening-Primrose’ or ‘Shortfin Evening-Primrose’"},
